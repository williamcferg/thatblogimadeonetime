        <h3>Designer. Changemaker. Human.</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm <b>William</b>. I'm interested in technology and psychology to design <b>products</b> and <b>experiences</b> to help people become smarter, healthier, and happier in life.</p>
        <p>Social change, building companies, vulnerability, philosophy books, and yoga never cease to fascinate me. More importantly, <b>coffee</b> is my favorite hobby from learning about roasting methods to practicing various brewing methods.</p>
        <p>Currently, I go to class (sometimes) at <b>Penn State</b>. Most of my time in school is spent helping HESE, creating a class for students to design their own path, and processing my thoughts by writing. Outside of class, I spend time growing <b>Innoblue</b> and the <b>Penn State Summer Founders Program</b>.</p>
